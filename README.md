# Online Food Ordering System

This project is a simple food ordering application created using Python and Streamlit. 
The goal of the system is to allow a user to sign up, log in, view the menu, choose items, 
add them to a cart, and finally place an order. The order history is also saved so the 
user can check their previous orders.

The project does not use a database. Instead, all information is stored in JSON files 
(users, orders, and menu data). This keeps the project easy to understand and suitable 
for learning or coursework.
